### About Me
I am a graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at University of Hawaii at Manoa. Previously, I received a Master's in Mathematics from University of Virginia. I completed my undergrad in Mathematics and Physics at University of Florida and was a student research assistant on the LIGO Project. 

I greatly enjoy using computer simulations to help inform theory. My current interests are in Stochastic Approximation as seen [here](http://members.unine.ch/michel.benaim/perso/SPS99.pdf) and [here](https://www.cambridge.org/us/universitypress/subjects/statistics-probability/applied-probability-and-stochastic-networks/stochastic-approximation-dynamical-systems-viewpoint).
